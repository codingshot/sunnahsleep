Building the Sunnah habit isn't about doing everything at once. It's about showing up. Pray Isha. Dust the bed. Recite Ayat al-Kursi. Even one step counts. The Prophet ﷺ said the most beloved deeds to Allah are those done consistently, even if small. Track your progress. See your streak. Let consistency build the routine.
