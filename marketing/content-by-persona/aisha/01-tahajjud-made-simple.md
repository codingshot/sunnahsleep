**HOOK:** The last third of the night—when Allah descends. We calculate it for you.

**BODY:**
The Prophet ﷺ said Allah descends to the lowest heaven in the last third of the night and says: "Who is calling upon Me that I may answer him?" (Bukhari 1145). Calculating that time by hand is tedious. SunnahSleep does it automatically from Maghrib to Fajr for your location. Set a Tahajjud alarm. Add "30 min before Fajr" if you prefer. Qailulah reminder helps you rest before night worship.
