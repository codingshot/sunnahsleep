## FAQ Copy

### Is my data private?
Yes. SunnahSleep stores everything locally on your device—checklist, sleep log, alarms, diary. We don't collect, track, or transmit any personal data. No account means no profile, no server, no cloud.

### Does it work offline?
Yes. Once installed, the checklist, recitations, Tasbih, sleep tracker, and Quran audio work offline. Prayer times need an initial connection to fetch for your location, then they're cached. Alarms work when the app is open or in the background (subject to browser limits).

### Will alarms work when the app is closed?
In a PWA, alarms work best when the app is open or recently used. Browser power-saving can limit background execution. We recommend keeping the app open before sleep or using a backup alarm for critical wake times like Fajr. Grant notification permission when prompted for the best experience.

### Do I need to create an account?
No. Open the app, set your location (or let us detect it), and start using it. All your progress is stored on your device. If you clear browser data, you'll start fresh—by design, for privacy.
