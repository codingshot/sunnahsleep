# Cross-Platform Content Workflow

Take one piece of content and reformat it for all social platforms.

## Step 1: Create Master Content

Write the **core message** once. Include:
- Hook (first line)
- Main point (2–3 sentences)
- CTA (call to action)
- Hashtags (optional)
- Source/fact-check note (if Islamic content)

**Template:**
```
HOOK: [Attention-grabbing first line]

BODY: [2-3 sentences, key info]

CTA: [e.g., "Try SunnahSleep free → sunnahsleep.app"]

SOURCES: [If hadith/stat: collection + number, or study link]
```

## Step 2: Run Fact-Check

If content includes hadith, Quran, or statistics:
1. Follow [WORKFLOW-FACT-CHECK.md](WORKFLOW-FACT-CHECK.md)
2. Confirm sources before reformatting

## Step 3: Reformatted for Each Platform

| Platform | Adaptation |
|----------|------------|
| **Instagram** | Hook + 2–3 lines + CTA. Use line breaks. Hashtags: #SunnahSleep #IslamicSleep #Sunnah |
| **Twitter/X** | Condense to ≤280 chars. Lead with hook. Link at end. |
| **Facebook** | Can use full length. Add emoji for engagement. Consider question to drive comments. |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional tone. Focus on habit-building, wellness, productivity angle. |
| **TikTok** | Hook in first 3 seconds. On-screen text: key point. CTA in caption. |

## Step 4: Save to social/ Folders

Place ready copy in:
- `social/instagram/[date]-[topic].md`
- `social/twitter/[date]-[topic].md`
- etc.

## Page-Specific Content

Some content maps to app pages (not just social):
- **Install page:** `content-types/install-page/INSTALL-PAGE-CONTENT.md` — Use for /install page copy, ads, and install-focused social posts
