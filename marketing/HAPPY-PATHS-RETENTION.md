## 3. Retention Optimization Tactics

### Activation (First Session)
| Tactic | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Zero friction** | No account; location auto-detected; instant checklist |
| **Quick win** | Completing 1 item shows streak "1" immediately |
| **Clear value** | Hero copy: "Follow the Prophetic Sunnah before sleep" |

### Habit Formation (Week 1–2)
| Tactic | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Streak visibility** | Header shows streak; CompletionCelebration on full checklist |
| **Alarm as anchor** | Isha/Fajr alarms bring user back at fixed times |
| **Diary prompt** | After wake-up, prompt to add diary entry (drives return) |

### Sustained Retention (Month 1+)
| Tactic | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Stats dashboard** | Sleep tab shows Isha%, Fajr%, avg duration, this week |
| **History** | Sleep history gives long-term view; encourages logging |
| **Guides & Blog** | Deeper content for returning users; SEO traffic |

### Re-Engagement (Dormant Users)
| Tactic | Future implementation |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Browser notification** | "Isha in 30 min" if alarm set (PWA) |
| **Streak at risk** | "You're on a 5-day streak—don't break it tonight" |
| **Seasonal** | Ramadan mode; Laylat al-Qadr emphasis |

## 4. Friction Points to Minimize

| Friction | Mitigation |
|----------|------------|
| Account/signup | None required; never prompt |
| Location permission | Auto-detect via IP; manual city search fallback |
| Notification permission | Request only when setting alarm; explain benefit |
| Long onboarding | No tutorial; checklist is self-explanatory |
| Offline breakage | PWA; Quran audio cached; core UI works offline |
