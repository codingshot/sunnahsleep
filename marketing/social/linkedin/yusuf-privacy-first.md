In 2024, the FTC found that major apps engage in "vast surveillance"—collecting far more data than users realize. Location data can reveal visits to mosques, medical facilities, and homes.

For Islamic apps, this creates a dilemma: users want spiritual tools, but many are rightfully cautious about what gets collected.
